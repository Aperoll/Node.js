# Node.js
v1.0 Requesting API and verifying that the client request was successful with a statusCode output of 200.

v1.1 Practicing defensive coding(?) by writing in a function that would execute in the event of an error. Because node.js is non-blocking, also wrote in a function that would concatenate all the blocks of response data. Parsed JSON string into an object and successfully grabbed the summoner name, level, and id.
